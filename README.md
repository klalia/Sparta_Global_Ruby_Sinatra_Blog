This page consists of 5 blog examples where more can be added and more can be deleted. This is blog consists of the MVC model. The model is where the data is stored and in this case the data is stored in a databse called 'blog'. The databsse has been created through postgres and has SQL statements injected in the model folder of this application. The view is what the user can see and consists of partials that yields the whole page together. The controller is where the paths have all been set up. It gets the information from the model and manipulates it, to go on to displaying it on the view to the user.
